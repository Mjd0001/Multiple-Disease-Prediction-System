# 📦 Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System

This web application, built using Streamlit, integrates three machine learning models to provide predictions for multiple health conditions: Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. The app enables users to input relevant medical data and receive predictions from the trained models. It's a simple and accessible way to deploy machine learning models in healthcare, making predictive analysis available to a wider audience.
